# Eclipse
ECLIPSE, an ML model, helps to visualize the key parameters of an eclipse. It takes parameters related to eclipse from the user to process it as per the pre-trained data using random forest regressor algorithm to produce near precise predictions, as any ML model is not perfectly accurate. This model does away with the immense calculations which need to be carried out by the researchers and scientists in order to predict the eclipse and yields instant results which will save the time and complexity of the calculations that the researcher might have to face.
